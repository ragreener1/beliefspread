# Module beliefspread

This module contains a number of packages for modelling how beliefs spread and cause behaviour.

# Package com.robgreener.beliefspread.core

This package contains the core components required to model how beliefs spread.
It just describes how beliefs arise from observed behaviour.
It does not describe how behaviour arises from beliefs.

# Package com.robgreener.beliefspread.bdi

This package extends classes in `com.robgreener.beliefspread.core` providing a BDI model.

Currently, this package should be viewed as highly unstable.
